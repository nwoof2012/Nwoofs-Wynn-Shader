# About
Are you looking to play Wynncraft with shaders, but don't want to compromise on playability or visuals? _**Nwoof's Wynn Shader**_ is designed with a goal to fulfill that wish at its core. Designed and written based on problems encountered by Wynncraft players regarding shaders, this is the first shader designed with the Wynncraft player's experience in mind.

# Features
- ## Shadowmapping
  Virtual texture-based shadow system. Provides customization options such as adjustable resolution and culling distance.
- ## Bloom
  Simulates a glow effect for added realism to the world's lighting and illumination. The amount of total samples in this effect can be adjusted to provide the right balance of performance and visual quality.
- ## Lighting
  The lighting algorithms include Scene-Aware Lighting that adjusts the color of the world's lighting based on the original light source, toggleable Path-Traced Global Illumination which simulates the emission and reflection of light rays, and a customizable range for controlling/balancing light levels. There is also Custom Water with Screen Space Reflections and Light Refraction.
- ## Sky
  The shader also comes with sky features such as Customizable Sky/Fog/Atmosphere Colors for various times of day, and Volumetric Clouds that adapt to the weather.
- ## Scene-Aware Grading
  When travelling throughout the world, the tonemapping and color grading will automatically adjust to a scheme which is appropriate for your location.
- ## Mod Support
  Nwoof's Wynn Shader has integrated support for mods like [Wynncraft Dynamic Weather](https://modrinth.com/mod/wynncraft-dynamic-weather), [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons), and [Physics Mod](https://www.patreon.com/Haubna).
